## Contributing to Dictionaries

Feel free to make good issues and/or thoughtful pull requests to Dictionaries. There are a few rules though, like always

#### They have to be thoughtful

The "Update README.md" trend is not welcome here. AI slop is also not welcome.

Make sure to be detailed in issues and PRs.

#### Code must be up to my (low) standards

Keep the code format relatively the same, and don't use hacky workarounds or (preferably) OS-level calls (opening hardcoded files, running commands).

#### Be respectful

If I decide I don't want to go through with your contribution, I don't currently have the time to look at it deeply, or if your issue/contribution is invalid, then don't flame me for it

Same for others, don't flame others if their contribution isn't up to your standards. At the end of the day, everyone may miss something every once in a while (and btw I own the repo, so your standards aren't gonna matter much here)
